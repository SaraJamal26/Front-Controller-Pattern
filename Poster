The Front Controller pattern is a type of behavioral design pattern. Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that focus on the communication between objects and how objects operate together to achieve a certain behavior.
Introduction: The front controller design pattern is a software design pattern that provides a centralized point of access for handling requests. A single handler to handle all requests. It is often used in web applications to handle incoming HTTP requests and dispatch them to the appropriate resources for processing.
The front controller acts as a gatekeeper, receiving all incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate resources for handling. It can also perform authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized requests are processed.
