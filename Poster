The Front Controller pattern is a type of behavioral design pattern. Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that focus on the communication between objects and how objects operate together to achieve a certain behavior.
Introduction: The front controller design pattern is a software design pattern that provides a centralized point of access for handling requests. A single handler to handle all requests. It is often used in web applications to handle incoming HTTP requests and dispatch them to the appropriate resources for processing.
The front controller acts as a gatekeeper, receiving all incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate resources for handling. It can also perform authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized requests are processed.
Objective: The main objective of front controller pattern is toprovide centeral mechanism system that can do following tasks:
Authentication,Authorization,Logging and Tracking,Routing and Consistency
Pros & Cons: Some of the Pros of Front Controller Pattern are:
Improved security:  the front controller can act as a security gatekeeper.
 Improved performance: front controller can cache common resources in data ,reduces number of expensive calls.
 Improved maintainability: changes to the application's request handling logic can be made in a single location.
Some of Cons are:
Increased complexity: as there is now an additional layer of abstraction between the incoming request and the resources that handle it.
Increased development time:  as it involves creating a new layer of abstraction in the application.
Reduced flexibility:  as these changes must be made in a single location.
